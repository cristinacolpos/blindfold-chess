    Parameters:
        event: AWS Lambda uses this parameter to pass in event data to the handler. Dict type.
        context: AWS Lambda uses this parameter to provide runtime information to your handler. LambdaContext type.

    Determine the type of request and handle appropriately
    The Alexa service sends your service a request using one of the standard request types when users engage with your skill by voice. There are three request types:
         LaunchRequest: Sent when the user invokes your skill without providing a specific intent.
         IntentRequest: Sent when the user makes a request that corresponds to one of the intents defined in your intent schema.
         SessionEndedRequest: Sent when the current skill session ends for any reason other than your code closing the session.
    Documentation: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-types-reference.html
